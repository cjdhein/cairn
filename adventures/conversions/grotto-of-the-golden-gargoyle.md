# Grotto of Golden Gargoyle

- [Grotto of Golden Gargoyle](https://pocket-sized-perils.itch.io/grotto-of) by [Brendan Barnett](https://dexsave.blogspot.com)
- Conversion by Yochai Gal

## Notes

- Treat "turns" as dungeon cycles, as each PC has only one turn per cycle.
- **Petrification Curse**: Victim slowly turns to stone. 
  - Each day the player rolls 1d6 to determine which body part turns to stone (reroll duplicates):  
  - 1: Nose, 2: Fingers, 3: Ears, 4: Toes, 5: Forehead, 6: Lips. 
  - After a week they are fully petrified.
